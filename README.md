## Prerequisite
- Working knowledge of [NikGapps configuration file](https://nikgapps.com/misc/2022/02/22/NikGapps-Config.html)
- That's it. No server, No core Gapps knowledge, No other cost!

## Is there a video tutorial to create a custom build?
- Yes, if you want to skip reading and jump to video tutorial. Here is the [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/jZWR9Wz7hMk) that you should follow to create a custom build.

## How it'll work?
- Fork [this repository](https://github.com/nikgapps/config) (Find the fork icon on top right corner of this page)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikgapps/nikgapps.github.io/master/images/ForkRepo.png)

- Wait till the forking is finished

- Once finished, Download the latest version of [nikgapps.config](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nikgapps/files/Releases/Config/) (Always)
- Copy the downloaded file to specific target android version folder (for e.g, config must be part of '10' folder if you wish to create a build targeting android 10, similarly for android 11 and above)  
**<ins>NOTE:</ins>** Do not reuse/modify or delete any existing '.config' files from any of the folders to avoid problems during building and troubleshooting 
- Rename the config file you downloaded and set the name you want to give your custom NikGapps build to. For e.g. `xyz.config` will create `NikGapps-xyz-arm64-androidversion-date-signed.zip` 
- Configure your config file, set `AppSet=1` or `>>Package=1` if you want to include it in your package, else set it to `0`
  - You may also set packages to `2` to include it in your package and prevent the AOSP package from being removed when your package is installed
  - For e.g. `YouTube=1`, `PixelLauncher=1`, `>>PixelTips=1` will keep these packages in your custom gapps build while `Drive=0` will skip the package (Any other values will be ignored)  
- Commit the config file to your forked repository (make sure the name is unique, it can be anything with extention '.config')
- Send a pull request to merge your config file in this repository
- Wait for the pull request to get merged (should take less than 30 mins)
- Once the pull request is merged, NikGapps ecosystem will build your desired gapps
- Once your custom gapps package is build, the config file will be moved to archive with '_date' appended to it
- Find the date folder in [Config-Releases](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nikgapps/files/Config-Releases/) where you will find your build created
- Since July 28, 2023, Sourceforge server is running into issues while connecting, thus until the issue is resolved, we've mirrorred the builds and you can find your build [here](https://t.me/NikGappsGroup/185401).

## How to request for a custom build again
- Follow above steps again as once the custom build is created, config file will be moved to archive
